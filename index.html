                    MacBook Pro elevates the notebook to a whole new level of performance and portability. Wherever your ideas 
                    take you, you’ll get there faster than ever with high-performance processors and memory, advanced graphics, 
                    blazing-fast storage and more.

                    Thunderbolt 3 combines ultra‑high bandwidth with the ultra‑versatility of the USB-C industry standard to create
                    one revved-up universal port. It integrates data transfer, charging and video output in a single connector, 
                    delivering up to 40 Gbps of throughput for twice the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2. Both sizes of MacBook Pro are 
                    available with four ports, so you can do all of that from either side. Existing devices are easily connected with 
                    a cable or adapter. And Thunderbolt 3 is reversible, so no matter how you plug in, it’s always right side up.

                            MacBook Pro features a Radeon Pro discrete GPU in every 15‑inch model, combining impressive power with 
                            remarkable power efficiency. The 13‑inch model with Touch Bar features powerful integrated graphics with 
                            128MB of embedded DRAM — twice as much as the previous generation — which accelerates graphics tasks. 
                            That means more time for what matters most — creating amazing work.

                <h2>macOS</h2>
                <h3>macOS. It’s why there’s nothing else like a Mac.</h3>
                <p>
                    macOS is the operating system that powers every Mac. It lets you do things you simply can’t with other computers. 
                    That’s because it’s designed specifically for the hardware it runs on — and vice versa. macOS comes with an entire 
                    suite of beautifully designed apps. It works hand in hand with iCloud to keep photos, documents and other stuff up 
                    to date on all your devices. It makes your Mac work like magic with your iPhone. And it’s been built from the ground 
                    up with privacy and security in mind.
                </p>
                <h3>Easy to Use. When it’s simple to do everything, you can do anything.</h3>
                <p>
                    On a Mac, everything is designed to work just the way you expect it to — from operating it with simple, 
                    intuitive gestures to asking Siri to find a file to having your apps automatically update themselves. 
                    Whatever you set out to do on a Mac, there’s much less to learn and that much more to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h3>All your devices. One seamless experience.</h3>
                <p>
                    Your Mac works with your other Apple devices in ways no other computer can. If you get a call on your iPhone, 
                    you can take it on your Mac. You can copy text or an image from one device and paste it into another with standard 
                    copy and paste commands. You can even unlock your Mac just by walking up to it wearing your Apple Watch. No password 
                    typing required.
